        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The *Harry Potter* series, created by <a href="https://www.jkrowling.com/about/" target="_blank" style="color: #969696;">J.K. Rowling</a>, is one of the most beloved fantasy franchises in modern literature and film. The story follows Harry Potter, a young boy who discovers he is a wizard and attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Across seven books, Harry and his friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, face numerous challenges, culminating in a battle against the dark wizard Lord Voldemort.

            The books were adapted into eight films from 2001 to 2011, capturing the magical world with groundbreaking visual effects. The movies brought the characters and the enchanting world of Hogwarts to life, making stars out of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione), and Rupert Grint (Ron). The film series was a huge success globally and has spawned spin-offs, including the *Fantastic Beasts* films, expanding the Wizarding World universe further.</p>

        <h2>Death of Evil</h2>
        <p>The climax of the *Harry Potter* series reaches its pinnacle in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* during the epic **Battle of Hogwarts**. After years of conflict, Harry, Ron, and Hermione have destroyed almost all of Voldemort’s Horcruxes—objects containing fragments of his soul that keep him immortal. The final battle is set at Hogwarts, where students, teachers, and members of the Order of the Phoenix join forces to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

            In a selfless act, Harry realizes that to defeat Voldemort, he must die, as a piece of Voldemort's soul resides within him. He confronts Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest and willingly lets the dark wizard cast the Killing Curse. However, Harry survives due to the protection his mother’s sacrifice left on him, as well as the fact that the Elder Wand—Voldemort’s weapon—truly belongs to Harry.
            
            In the final duel in the Great Hall, Harry reveals this to Voldemort, and when Voldemort casts the Killing Curse again, it backfires, destroying him once and for all. With Voldemort's death, the Wizarding World is freed from his tyranny, and peace is restored. The climax represents the triumph of love, friendship, and sacrifice over darkness and evil.</p>
